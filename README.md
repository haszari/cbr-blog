### Haszari's node-blog

I have forked this to get it working with posts stored in MongoDB and various other tweaks I might like.

### node-blog 

[node-blog](http://semu.mp/node-blog.html) is a basic blog written in Node.js with nice inline composing and markdown storage. All writing is done within your web browser using the [ace editor](http://ace.ajax.org/), published articles as well as drafts are stored as [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files on your server.
